    <section class="about-me">
        <p>My Fulbright scholarship brought me to the United States in 2014. Five years later, I returned to my home country with my PhD and idealism. The next four years seemed perfect from the outside, a picture of success. But the truth is, things didn't go quite as I'd imagined. There's more to the story than meets the eye. Buried under a mountain of bureaucracy, administrative tasks, and a handful of gnawing moral dilemmas, all of which combined took a toll on me, I was left with no choice but to leave. Thankfully, with a twist of fate, I could start a new life in the United States in 2024.</p>
        <p>As an interdisciplinary researcher, I bring a unique global perspective and a proven track record in international collaboration. My expertise spans both traditional and computational research methods, allowing me to leverage cutting-edge technologies and contemporary approaches to bridge the gap between information technology, computer science, and social sciences, and to reach a wider audience.</p>
        <p>Beyond academia, I enjoy swimming, watching movies, TV shows, anime, and AC Milan matches. I also play Civilization games in my spare time.</p>

            <h3>PhD in Technology, Policy, and Innovation <img src="img/sbu.png" style="width: 20px; height: 20px; vertical-align: middle; margin-left: 10px;"></h3>
            <h4>Stony Brook University | 2014-2019</h4>
            <p>Drawing on my mostly technical background in IT, I pursued a highly interdisciplinary PhD focused on the social science aspects of mobile learning. My dissertation investigated mobile device ownership and mobile learning adoption among secondary school students. Employing a diverse range of quantitative techniques on my survey data, I discovered a fascinating shift in user preferences. For adolescents, the "fun factor" emerged as a more significant driver of mobile learning adoption compared to traditional considerations of usefulness and ease of use.</p>

            <h4>New York University | 2017</h4>
            <p>Through the Inter-University Doctoral Consortium, I broadened my research skillset by taking courses in Learning Science and Cognitive Science. This interdisciplinary approach allowed me to understand the human factors that shape educational technology adoption and its impact on learning outcomes.</p>

            <h4>2023</h4>
            <p>As part of an international consortium, I led a local team at one of the member universities. Together, we secured a significant €1.35 million grant from the European Union under Horizon Europe: Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions (MSCA). This funding facilitated a staff exchange program between nine universities in Europe and Southeast Asia for four years. I also briefly served on the management board before departing in 2023.</p>

            <h3><a href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/opportunities/opportunities-for-organisations/learning-mobility-of-individuals/higher-education-students-and-staff">Erasmus+ Inter-institutional Staff and Student Mobility &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-euro-sign"></i></a></h3>
            <h4>2023</h4>
            <p>Through my key role within the local team at the partner university in Indonesia, I played a part in securing an Erasmus+ exchange program funded by the European Union. This program facilitated valuable learning mobility for students and staff between Indonesia and Norway.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grant">
            <h3><a href="https://sicss.io/2022/jogja/">Summer Institutes in Computational Social Science &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-computer"></i></a></h3>
            <h4>2022</h4>
            <p>Leveraging a grant from the Social Science Research Council (SSRC), I played a key role in co-organizing and hosting SICSS-Jogja 2022. This event, along with its sister-site SICSS-Singapore 2022, marked a historic first for the entire Southeast Asia region.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grant">
            <h3>Productive Innovative Research Grant &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-microscope"></i></h3>
            <h4>2022</h4>
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic's forced transition to remote learning presented a multifaceted challenge. Elementary students faced hurdles in grasping math concepts at home, while teachers navigated remote instruction and parents juggled work with supporting their children's education. The lack of access to personal computers in many households further exacerbated this issue.  To address these challenges, I led a research team that secured a national grant to develop a mobile math learning solution specifically designed for elementary students at home.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grant">
            <h3>Institutional Funding Research Initiative &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-microscope"></i></h3>
            <h4>2021</h4>
            <p>The rapid surge of e-learning during the COVID-19 pandemic heightened concerns around security, privacy, and user confidentiality. To address this critical issue, my international colleagues and I successfully secured a research grant to investigate the current landscape in these areas.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="grant">
            <h3>Competitive Faculty Research Grant &nbsp;<i class="fa-solid fa-microscope"></i></h3>
            <h4>2020</h4>
            <p>The university's recent implementation of a Single Sign-On (SSO) system aimed to streamline access, but initial user adoption didn't necessarily translate to heightened security awareness. To bridge this gap, I led a research team that secured a grant to evaluate the situation and uncover the underlying factors. Our findings provided valuable insights for designing effective security awareness interventions.</p>
